## Project Overview:

1. The project involved the extraction of data into MySQL, database creation, and establishing connections between them. The data was then imported into Power BI datasets, with an emphasis on revising SQL commands.

2. Data processing tasks such as data wrangling, cleaning, and modeling were undertaken, culminating in the creation of comprehensive dashboards. The data modeling was executed using a snowflake schema across more than 10 tables.

3. Further work involved creating numerous calculated measures using DAX formulas. These measures contributed to the creation of distinct dashboards catering to different target audiences, including Finance, Sales, Supply Chain, and Executive Management.

4. Incorporating feedback during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was a noteworthy effort, especially when considering how to present information effectively within limited screen space. Utilizing tooltip functionality allowed the inclusion of supplementary views.

5. The project was finalized by deploying the solution through the Power BI web service. Notably, a dynamic navigation bar was implemented to enhance the overall user experience, providing a cohesive end-to-end project.

## Key Learning and Tools:

The project reinforced the understanding that the focus should be on problem-solving rather than the tools used. The technologies and skills employed included:

- SQL
- Power BI Desktop (Power Query, M Language)
- Excel
- DAX language
- DAX Studio (for report optimization)
- Project charter documentation
- Power BI Techniques and Concepts Applied:

## Domain knowledge:
The project involved intricate calculations and analysis of various business metrics, such as gross price, pre-invoice deductions, post-invoice deductions, net invoice sale, gross margin, net sales, net profit, cost of goods sold (COGS), YTD (Year to Date), YTG (Year to Go), and more. These calculations encompassed different entities like gross and net aspects, and various stakeholders including direct, retailer, distributors, and consumers.
